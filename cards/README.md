This is source code for the Crocker/Dovgan card images. The `suits.ts` file
contains SVG path definitions for the suit pips, the `ranks.ts` has paths for
the rank indices, and the `face_xx.ts` files contain whole nested SVGs of the
face card figures. The `build_cards.ts` script arranges and bundles them all
into actual playing cards.
